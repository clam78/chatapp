        <ul>
            <li>I utilized colors to illustrate contrast (blue vs white texts)</li>
            <li>I utilized common design patterns such as a search with autocomplete</li>
            <li>I utilized animations for hovering and selecting chats</li>
            <li>I utilized rounded corners for consistency across different elements, to add a sense of softness so the app feels more friendly</li>
            <li>Ultimately, there are still a lot of things that can be improved about this app such as functionalities to filter search by gender, or adding a roommate-matching algorithm in there</li>
            <li>However, it serves as a nice prototype with lots of potential</li>
            <li>I found the prototyping exercises to be very helpful in developing my final product -- for example, I knew I wanted several profile creation screens, one for roommate-specific questions.</li>
            <li>From user testing, I realized the importance of being able to undo/go back, both for safety and for efficiency</li>
        </ul>

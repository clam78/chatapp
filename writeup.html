        <title>Chat App Writeup</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <ul>
            <li>I utilized colors to illustrate contrast (blue vs white texts)</li>
            <li>I utilized common design patterns such as a search with autocomplete</li>
            <li>I utilized animations for hovering and selecting chats</li>
            <li>I utilized rounded corners for consistency across different elements, to add a sense of softness so the app feels more friendly</li>
            <li>Ultimately, there are still a lot of things that can be improved about this app such as functionalities to filter search by gender, or adding a roommate-matching algorithm in there</li>
            <li>However, it serves as a nice prototype with lots of potential</li>
            <li>I found the prototyping exercises to be very helpful in developing my final product -- for example, I knew I wanted several profile creation screens, one for roommate-specific questions.</li>
            <li>From user testing, I realized the importance of being able to undo/go back, both for safety and for efficiency</li>
            <li>I also made the right side with messages to be scrollable with the send input at the bottom, so they don't overlap. This is a use of design pattern that I see in many other messaging apps.</li>
            <li>I added an Edit Profile button that allows users to go back and change their answers or their password. This is very useful in case they want to add more information.</li>
            <li>Further, the Edit Profile pages autofill with previous answers so it is more efficient.</li>
            <li>I removed the alert and instead, when the user enters the wrong password, some text in red appears telling the user to try again.</li>
            <li>Overall, my app still has some bugs that I am trying to fix, but design-wise it is very simple with good color contrast and is hopefully intuitive to use as I followed common design patterns.</li>
        </ul>
